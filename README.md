# New-DG-Food-Agro-multinational-exporter
Objective: Our objective is to cluster the countries based on various sales data provided to us  across years. We have to apply an unsupervised learning technique like K means or  Hierarchical clustering so as to get the final solution. But before that we have to bring the  exports (in tons) of all countries down to same scale across years. Plus, as this solution needs  to be repeatable we will have to do PCA so as to get the principal components which explain  max variance.
